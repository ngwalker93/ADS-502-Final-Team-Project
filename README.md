# ADS-502 Final Team Project: Applied Data Mining 
# Using Data Mining to Combat Credit Card Fraud and Reduce Merchant Losses

This repository contains the final project for the ADS 502 course.
The objective was to presents a data science project that was designed to detect credit card fraud for CyberPay, a 
fintech company supporting e-commerce transactions. Initiated by a request from one of CyberPay’s 
largest merchants, BigDeals - who faced rising fraud losses and threatened to leave the platform.

One million anonymized transaction records were publicly sourced from Kaggle
